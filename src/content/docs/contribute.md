description: A guideline on how we encourage people to contribute to our cause
---

First of all, **thank you for even thinking about contributing**.  
Nadi Stuti and Nadi Kosh are small, early‑stage efforts standing in front of a very big dream: to serve Bharat’s sacred rivers with all the strength, skills, and sincerity we have.

Right now, we are a tiny team working in our free time — but with a **mountain of work** ahead of us.  
Your willingness to join, in any capacity, already makes you part of this journey.

## 🌊 What are Nadi Stuti and Nadi Kosh?

- **Nadi Stuti** is our larger movement, dedicated to:

  - Restoring the sanctity of rivers to the same sacred stature as our temples.
  - Building a trusted digital ecosystem around rivers: apps, content, tools, and on‑ground support.
  - Bringing together government bodies, experts, NGOs, ashrams, and grassroots sevaks on one platform.

- **Nadi Kosh** is the **databank and knowledge repository** that supports this movement.  
  Here we collect, store, and refine the knowledge, information, leads, and data needed for all Nadi Stuti activities.

If you are reading this file, it means you are already close to our heart.  
Below are different ways you can contribute — some require technical skills, many do not.

---

## 1. 🌱 Gathering information & spreading the word

You do **not** need to be a researcher or a coder to contribute.  
If you carry even a little knowledge or love for rivers, you can help.

### Share river knowledge with us

If you:

- Know stories about your local river.
- Have read books or articles about rivers.
- Have seen good reports, research, or documentaries.
- Have personal experiences, memories, or observations from ghats, banks, or pilgrimages.

You can:

1. **Join our WhatsApp community** from our website:  
   👉 Visit [**How we work**](/how-we-work) and follow the link to join the WhatsApp group.
2. Share small **tidbits of information** – even a few lines, a photo, or a link.
3. Our team will take care of formatting and publishing it into Nadi Kosh.

Even a short note like _“I saw this initiative on my local river”_ can become a seed for deeper research.

### Help us reach knowledgeable people

Another powerful way to help is to **connect us to others**:

- Share our website [**Nadi Stuti website**](https://nadistuti.com) with people who love rivers.
- Share or print our materials (see [Print](/print)) and give them to teachers, gurus, activists, NGOs, and local leaders.
- Introduce us (even informally) to anyone who has deep river knowledge — traditional or technical.

Sometimes, **the right connection** is more valuable than any single document.

## 2. 🧠 App & software development (AI/ML & more)

We are taking on a **mammoth effort**: building a whole ecosystem of apps and software that use technology (including AI/ML) in the service of river conservation and cleaning.

If you are:

- An experienced developer (backend, frontend, mobile, or full‑stack).
- Familiar with **AI/ML, data processing, or geospatial tools**.
- Interested in building tools that directly support on‑ground work.

You can:

1. Visit the **`Tech/`** section of this repository (and related docs) to see the apps and tools we are planning.
2. Identify any idea or product that excites you.
3. Join our WhatsApp community via [**How we work**](/how-we-work) and introduce yourself, your skills, and your interests.
4. Volunteer for a specific product or feature that resonates with you.

We are especially grateful for people who can **own a small piece of the ecosystem** — a micro‑service, a data pipeline, a visualization, or a ML model — and shape it with care.

## 3. ✨ Storytelling & content creation

We believe our rivers deserve to have their **stories told beautifully**.

If you have experience in:

- Storytelling or script writing.
- Social media content creation (YouTube, Instagram, X, etc.).
- Video editing, design, or copywriting.
- Podcasting, audio narration, or voiceover work.

Then you can help us:

- Craft engaging narratives about our rivers — their history, culture, challenges, and hope.
- Turn raw knowledge from Nadi Kosh into **accessible videos, posts, threads, and articles**.
- Design content that inspires people to feel for the rivers and take action.

How to join:

1. Visit [**How we work**](/how-we-work) and join our Content Creators WhatsApp group.
2. Briefly share your background and which platforms or formats you enjoy working with.
3. We will slowly build an **awesome and coordinated content ecosystem** together.

Even one well‑told story can touch more hearts than a hundred dry reports.

## 4. 🕶️ VR content & immersive experiences

In our initial surveys, we discovered something powerful:  
People are **deeply excited** to experience rivers in VR, and many feel that for those who cannot travel, VR might be the best way to “visit” a river from home.

We already have some VR hardware and plan to push this space as much as we can.

You can help if you:

- Own a **360° / VR‑ready camera** and can capture river content.
- Have experience in **3D modelling, game development, or interactive environments**.
- Are excited to help people experience rivers in a deep, immersive way.

Ways to contribute:

- Capture 360° footage of rivers, ghats, riverbank festivals, or quiet stretches and share it with us.
- Help us design VR experiences or scenes that bring river stories to life.
- Collaborate on building VR “darshan” experiences for people who cannot travel physically.

To get involved:

1. Join our WhatsApp community from [**Nadi Stuti website**](https://nadistuti.com).
2. Mention that you are interested in **VR / 360° / 3D / game dev**.
3. We’ll explore how your skills and our hardware can come together in service of the rivers.

## 5. 📚 Book writing & publishing support

We aspire to publish books for many kinds of readers:

- **School children** – simple, visual, inspiring introductions to rivers.
- **Competitive exam aspirants** – factual, exam‑relevant river knowledge.
- **Elders and seekers** – spiritual and cultural understandings of our rivers.
- **Devotees and ritual practitioners** – practical guides for river‑related rituals.
- **Ground workers and river cleaners** – clear, practical guidebooks and knowledgebooks that help people who are directly involved in cleaning and restoring rivers on the ground.

If you have experience in:

- **Book writing** (authoring, structuring, editing).
- **Publishing** (layout, printing, distribution, ISBN, etc.).
- Educational content design or curriculum building.

Then your guidance can save us from many mistakes.

You can:

- Advise us on how to structure books for different age groups.
- Help refine drafts or outlines based on your publishing experience.
- Suggest realistic paths for printing, distribution, and making books accessible and affordable.

Please join our WhatsApp group via [**Nadi Stuti website**](https://nadistuti.com) and mention your experience in **book writing / publishing**. Even a few suggestions at the right time can shape these efforts for years to come.

## 6. 🤝 Content moderation & community stewardship

As Nadi Kosh grows, we will have:

- A **large volume of content** from many different domains.
- Devotees, experts, students, and volunteers all contributing in different ways.
- A constant need to keep information **accurate, respectful, and trustworthy**.

If you have an eye for detail and a heart for community, you can help us:

- Review content for **accuracy, clarity, and respectfulness**.
- Flag potential mistakes, misinformation, or unclear statements.
- Help new contributors feel welcome and guided.
- Support a culture where discussions stay focused on **serving the rivers**, not on conflict.

With your help, we want to grow an **ever‑expanding but well‑moderated community**, where people feel safe to contribute and also trust the information they see.

## 🌼 A humble request

We are still at the beginning of a very long journey.  
Our processes are not perfect. Our files may look messy. Our tools are still evolving.

But our **intention is clear**:

> To serve Bharat’s sacred rivers with all our strength, and to do it together — as a community, guided by sincerity and the grace of Shreeman Narayan.

If you are patient with our imperfections and willing to walk with us,  
we would be honoured to have you as part of this movement.
