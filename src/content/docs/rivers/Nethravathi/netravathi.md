### Economic and Cultural Significance

The Netravathi is vital for the region's ****agriculture and industry**** **.** It provides water for vast tracts of areca nut, coconut, and paddy fields. Additionally, the river is the primary source of drinking water for the city of Mangaluru.

Culturally, the river is deeply integrated into the local folklore and religious practices of the Tulu-speaking population. The "Netravathi Pushkara," a festival occurring once every 12 years, draws thousands of devotees to its banks for holy dips.
