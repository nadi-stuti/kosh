## Foundation: Why Astro?

Nadi Kosh is built with **Astro**, a modern static site generator (SSG) framework. But why Astro? And what makes it perfect for our knowledge repository?

### What is Astro?

**Astro** is a modern web framework optimized for building fast, content-focused websites. At its core, Astro is an **island architecture** framework that:

- **Ships zero JavaScript by default.** Your static HTML, CSS, and content are sent to browsers without unnecessary JavaScript overhead.
- **Supports multiple frameworks.** You can use React, Vue, Svelte, or even plain HTML components — all in the same project.
- **Optimizes for content.** Built-in support for Markdown and MDX, perfect for blogs, docs, and knowledge bases.
- **Provides file-based routing.** Create a file in `src/pages/`, and it automatically becomes a route.

### Why We Chose Astro

At Nadi Kosh, we made a deliberate choice to use Astro for several critical reasons:

<CardGrid stagger>

  <Card title="Superior Performance" icon="rocket">
    Astro builds pure HTML at build time. Visitors download minimal JavaScript, resulting in faster page loads, better SEO rankings, and lower bandwidth usage. For a knowledge repository serving millions of potential readers, performance is non-negotiable.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Best for Static Site Generation" icon="star">
    Nadi Kosh is primarily a static wiki and blog. Astro excels at this use case far more than heavy frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt. We do not need the overhead of server-side rendering for most of our content.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Island Architecture = Broad Contributor Base" icon="list-format">
    Astro's island architecture means you can add interactive components **only where needed**, without writing complex full-stack code. A frontend developer can contribute UI improvements. A content writer does not need to touch code. This democratizes contribution.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Simplicity & Developer Experience" icon="heart">
    Astro's learning curve is gentle. If you know HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, you can start contributing to Nadi Kosh quickly. We do not want developers to fight the framework — we want them to focus on the mission.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Excellent Ecosystem" icon="npm">
    Astro integrates beautifully with Starlight (documentation theme), Markdown processing, and static hosting (Netlify, Vercel). The ecosystem is mature and well-maintained.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Future-Proof Architecture" icon="right-arrow">
    Astro is actively developed and backed by a strong community. Its architecture is designed to stay relevant as web standards evolve.
  </Card>

</CardGrid>

### Get Started with Astro

Before contributing to Nadi Kosh, we strongly recommend you **complete the official Astro tutorial**:

## Starlight Theme: Our Documentation Foundation

On top of Astro, we use **Starlight** — a professional documentation theme designed specifically for knowledge bases, wikis, and educational sites.

### What is Starlight?

**Starlight** is an official Astro theme that provides:

- **Beautiful, responsive documentation layouts** optimized for reading long-form content.
- **Automatic sidebar generation** from your file structure.
- **Built-in search** for readers to find content quickly.
- **Mobile-friendly design** that works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops.
- **Dark mode support** for comfortable reading at any time.
- **Accessibility features** ensuring your content is readable by everyone.

Starlight handles the heavy lifting of UI, navigation, and styling, letting us focus on content and plugins.

### Key Directories Explained

#### `/src/assets/`

Contains **images, logos, and static media**:

```
src/assets/
├── images/
│   ├── logo.png
│   ├── rivers/
│   │   ├── ganga-banner.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── docs/
    └── diagrams/
```

**When to add files here:** Whenever you have images or media referenced in documentation. Always optimize images for web (compress, use modern formats).

#### `/src/components/`

Contains **reusable Astro components**:

```
src/components/
├── RiverCard.astro
├── EventCard.astro
├── TeamMember.astro
└── ...
```

**When to add files here:** When you create a component that is used in multiple pages. Single-use components can live inline in pages.

#### `/src/content/docs/`

This is where **all documentation content** lives. It is organized into folders that auto-generate sidebar sections:

- **Folders with `autogenerate` enabled** (defined in `layout.ts`) will automatically create sidebar sections from all `.md` files inside. Examples: `rivers/`, `books/`, `tech/`, etc.
- **Individual pages** like `about-nadikosh.md`, `contribute.md`, `how-we-work.mdx` are manually added to the sidebar in `astro.config.mjs`.

#### `/src/content/docs/blog/`

Special folder for blog posts. Managed by the `starlight-blog` plugin. All `.md` files here become blog articles with automatic:

- Reading time estimates
- Author information
- Publication dates
- RSS feed generation

---

## Starlight Plugins We Use

Nadi Kosh is enhanced with several carefully chosen Starlight plugins:

### 1. **starlight-theme-flexoki** — The Visual Experience

**What is it?**

A premium color theme for Starlight that gives your documentation a **book or newspaper aesthetic**. It is minimal, elegant, and optimized for reading without distraction.

**Why we chose it:**

- **Distraction-free reading experience.** The theme prioritizes content over UI chrome.
- **Yellow accent color** matches our Nadi Kosh logo and branding.
- **Professional appearance** suitable for an authoritative knowledge repository.
- **Accessibility first.** The flexoki theme is designed with WCAG standards in mind.

**Configuration (in `astro.config.mjs`):**

```typescript
starlightThemeFlexoki({
  accentColor: "yellow",
}),
```

This sets the accent color to yellow throughout the site — buttons, links, highlights, and interactive elements all use this color.

**Learn more:** Flexoki is a curated, minimal color scheme. To understand the design philosophy, explore the official Starlight theme documentation.

### 2. **starlight-blog** — Powering Our Blog

**What is it?**

A plugin that transforms a folder of Markdown files into a **fully-featured blog system** with:

- Automatic post listings sorted by date
- Reading time estimates
- Author information and profiles
- Tags and categories
- RSS feed generation
- Archive pages

**Why we use it:**

Nadi Stuti's blog is central to our mission. We publish long-form content — essays, guides, case studies, and announcements. The `starlight-blog` plugin handles all the plumbing so we can focus on writing.

**How we configured it (in `astro.config.mjs`):**

```typescript
starlightBlog({
  title: "Nadi Stuti Blog",
  metrics: {
    readingTime: true,        // Show estimated reading time
    words: "rounded",         // Round word count (e.g., "5 min read")
  },
  authors: {
    nulligma: {
      name: "Shantanu Kulkarni",
      title: "Nadi Sevak",
      picture: "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/722045969936703488/bLHK_LbW_400x400.jpg",
      url: "https://x.com/Nulligma/",
    },
    // Add more authors here as the team grows
  },
}),
```

**Key configuration options:**

- **`title`** — The blog section title shown to readers.
- **`metrics.readingTime`** — If `true`, displays "5 min read" estimates.
- **`metrics.words`** — How to round word counts ("rounded", "exact", "per-minute").
- **`authors`** — A key-value object of author profiles used in blog post frontmatter.

**How to write a blog post:**

Create a new file in `src/content/docs/blog/my-post.md` with this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Blog Post Title"
description: "A short description that appears in preview."
date: 2026-01-13
authors:
  - nulligma
tags: ["rivers", "updates", "conservation"]
---

# My Blog Post Title

Your content here...
```

**Read the documentation:** For in-depth blog configuration, author management, and advanced features:

👉 **[Starlight Blog Documentation](https://starlight-blog-docs.vercel.app/)**

---

### 3. **starlight-giscus** — Community Comments

**What is it?**

A plugin that integrates **Giscus** — a GitHub-backed comment system — into Starlight pages. Readers can leave comments, discussions, and feedback directly on documentation pages.

**Why we added it:**

We want readers to **interact with our content**. Comments allow:

- Readers to ask clarifying questions
- Experts to add additional insights
- Errors and outdated information to be flagged quickly
- Community dialogue around important topics

Unlike traditional comment systems, Giscus uses GitHub Discussions as its backend, so comments are:

- **Public and transparent**
- **Searchable and indexable**
- **Managed through GitHub** (no external service vendor lock-in)
- **Moderable by maintainers**

**How we configured it (in `astro.config.mjs`):**

```typescript
starlightGiscus({
  repo: "nadi-stuti/kosh",              // GitHub repo
  repoId: "R_kgDOQtuzhw",               // Repo ID from GitHub
  category: "General",                  // Discussion category
  categoryId: "DIC_kwDOQtuzh84C03D7",  // Category ID
  theme: {
    light: "gruvbox_light",             // Light mode theme
    dark: "gruvbox_dark",               // Dark mode theme
    auto: "gruvbox",                    // Auto-detect based on system
  },
}),
```

**How it works:**

When a reader visits a page with comments enabled, they see:

1. A comment section at the bottom of the page.
2. Existing comments from the GitHub Discussion thread.
3. An option to sign in with GitHub and post a new comment.

**Where comments appear:**

By default, comments are enabled on all pages **except**:

- `404.md` (not found page)
- `index.mdx` (home page)

You can customize this in individual page frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Page"
# Disable comments on this page specifically
giscus: false
---
```

**Moderation:**

Since Giscus uses GitHub Discussions, moderation happens through GitHub:

1. Visit your repo's Discussions tab.
2. Review and moderate comments directly.
3. Mark answers, close discussions, etc.

**Read the guide:** For complete setup and troubleshooting:

👉 **[Starlight Giscus Guide](https://dragomano.github.io/starlight-giscus/getting-started/)**

---

## GitHub Workflow & Deployment

Our version control and deployment process is designed to ensure **quality, transparency, and safety**.

### The Master Branch Is Protected

Our **`master` branch is locked** — no one can push commits directly to it. All changes must come through **pull requests (PRs)**.

**Why?**

- **Safety.** Every change is reviewed before going live.
- **Traceability.** Clear history of who changed what and why.
- **Quality.** Code review catches bugs and improvements before deployment.

### Pull Request Workflow

Here is how to contribute code or content:

<Steps>

1. **Create a feature branch** from `master`:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** locally:
   - Edit Markdown files, code, components, etc.
   - Test locally: `npm run dev` starts a development server at `http://localhost:4321`

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Clear description of what you changed"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Open a pull request** on GitHub:
   - Go to the repository and click "New Pull Request"
   - Set base to `master`, compare to your branch
   - Write a clear title and description
   - Request reviewers (maintainers or experts)

5. **Netlify preview** is automatically generated:
   - When you open a PR, Netlify builds a preview of the site with your changes
   - Visit the preview link to verify everything looks correct
   - Share the preview link in the PR for feedback

6. **Address feedback** from reviewers:
   - Make requested changes on your branch
   - Push them — the PR updates automatically
   - Re-request review when ready

7. **Merge when approved**:
   - A maintainer merges the PR into `master`
   - This automatically triggers a production deploy to Netlify
   - Your changes go live to `kosh.nadistuti.com`

</Steps>

### Netlify Deployment

When a PR is merged to `master`:

1. **Netlify detects the change** (via GitHub webhook)
2. **Builds the site** in ~2-5 minutes
3. **Deploys to production** automatically
4. **Your changes are live** — readers see them immediately

This means every merged PR = instant production deploy. Be careful, be thoughtful, be thorough in review!

---

## Sidebar & Navigation Configuration

Our sidebar (left navigation) is mostly **auto-generated** but requires some configuration.

### Auto-Generated Sections (Easy Mode)

Folders like `rivers/`, `books/`, `tech/`, etc. are configured in `src/lib/constants/layout.ts`:

```typescript
export const SidebarFolders = [
  {
    label: "Rivers",
    collapsed: true,
    autogenerate: {
      directory: "rivers",
      collapsed: true,
    },
  },
  {
    label: "Books",
    collapsed: true,
    autogenerate: {
      directory: "books",
      collapsed: true,
    },
  },
  // ... more folders
];
```

**How it works:**

- When you create a new `.md` file in `src/content/docs/rivers/`, it automatically appears under "Rivers" in the sidebar.
- No need to manually add it to configuration.
- Filenames become page titles (converted to Title Case).

**To add a new auto-generated section:**

1. Create a new folder in `src/content/docs/` (e.g., `new-section/`)
2. Add an entry to `layout.ts`:
   ```typescript
   {
     label: "New Section",
     collapsed: true,
     autogenerate: {
       directory: "new-section",
       collapsed: true,
     },
   }
   ```
3. Add `.md` files to the folder — they appear automatically

### Manually Configured Pages (Explicit)

Pages like `about-nadikosh`, `contribute`, `how-we-work` are added directly to `astro.config.mjs`:

```typescript
sidebar: [
  ...SidebarFolders,                              // Include auto-generated sections
  { slug: "about-nadikosh" },                     // Manual pages
  { slug: "print" },
  { label: "How we work", slug: "how-we-work" },
  { label: "Contribute", slug: "contribute" },
  { slug: "layout" },
  { slug: "updates" },
],
```

**Why manual?**

These pages are often:

- Special pages that should appear at the top level (not nested in a section)
- Not part of the main content structure
- Frequently accessed by all visitors

---

## File Structure Reference

### Adding Content (Markdown Files)

When you add a new `.md` file to `src/content/docs/`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Basic Structure">

```markdown
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "Short description for search and preview"
---

# Page Title (same as frontmatter title)

Your content here...
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="With More Options">

```markdown
---
title: "My River Guide"
description: "Everything you need to know about the Ganga"
# Optional: Featured image
# image:
#   src: /src/assets/ganga-river.jpg
#   alt: "The Ganga River at sunrise"

# Optional: Custom sidebar label
# sidebar:
#   label: "Ganga (Complete Guide)"
---

# My River Guide

## Future: Making Writing Frictionless

Right now, writers have two paths to contribute:

1. **Technical path:** Clone the repo, install VS Code, create a branch, write Markdown with YAML frontmatter, push, open PR.
2. **Non-technical path:** Write in any editor, send the file to a maintainer, they merge it manually.

Both have friction. We are planning to solve this with a **Git-based CMS** like **Keystatic**.

### The Problem

Our **dumping-grounds** and **blog** sections need to attract many writers — experts, educators, community members, activists. But requiring:

- GitHub knowledge
- Local setup (Git, Node.js, VS Code)
- YAML frontmatter syntax
- Markdown formatting precision

...creates barriers to entry.

Writers just want to **write freely, hit publish, and move on**. They should not have to become developers.

### The Solution: Keystatic

**Keystatic** is a Git-based CMS that bridges this gap perfectly.

#### What is Keystatic?

Keystatic is a **headless CMS** that:

- Runs **in your browser** at a URL like `kosh.nadistuti.com/admin`
- **Writes to your Git repo** automatically (no separate database)
- **Generates proper YAML frontmatter** for you
- **Handles file creation and structure** automatically
- **Previews changes** before publishing
- **Manages permissions** (decide who can write, edit, publish)

#### How It Solves Our Problem

<CardGrid>

  <Card title="Zero Technical Setup" icon="star">
    Writers visit a URL, sign in, and start writing. No Git, no terminal, no config files.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Automatic Frontmatter" icon="seti:markdown">
    Keystatic generates proper YAML metadata (title, date, author, tags) through a form. Writers never touch YAML.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Visual Editor" icon="seti:word">
    Write in a rich text editor, see a live preview, and publish with one click. All markdown is generated correctly.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Git Workflow Preserved" icon="seti:git">
    Behind the scenes, Keystatic still uses Git branches and PRs. Your code review process is intact.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Permission Control" icon="seti:lock">
    Configure who can write, edit, publish, and delete. Maintain editorial control even with open contributions.
  </Card>

</CardGrid>

#### How Keystatic + Dumping Grounds Would Work

**Current flow (manual + friction):**

```
Writer → Writes in Obsidian/Typora
       → Sends .md file to Content Creator group
       → Maintainer manually creates frontmatter, adds to repo + creates PR
       → Reviewer approves
       → Merged to master
       → Deployed
```

**Keystatic flow (streamlined + delightful):**

```
Writer → Opens kosh.nadistuti.com/admin
       → Clicks "New Note in Dumping Grounds"
       → Fills form: Title, Content, Tags, Author
       → Clicks "Save as Draft"
       → Clicks "Publish"
       → Keystatic creates branch + PR automatically
       → Reviewer approves PR on GitHub
       → Merged to master
       → Deployed
```

The difference?

- **Writers never see Git or YAML or frontmatter.** They see a friendly form.
- **Publishing is instant** — not "send to maintainers and wait."
- **Wrong frontmatter** Maintainer might add wrong frontmatter that writers didnt want
- **Mistakes are caught at review** (PR review, not manual formatting).
- **History is preserved** (Git commits show who wrote what, when).

#### Implementation Plan

To implement Keystatic for Nadi Kosh:

<Steps>

1. **Install Keystatic** in the Astro project:
   ```bash
   npm install @keystatic/core @keystatic/next
   ```

2. **Create a Keystatic config file** (`keystatic.config.ts`) that defines:
   - Collections (blog, dumping-grounds)
   - Fields (title, content, author, date, tags)
   - Permissions (who can write/publish)

3. **Set up GitHub OAuth** so writers can sign in securely via GitHub.

4. **Deploy the admin panel** at a route like `/admin` on Netlify.

5. **Configure Keystatic to create PRs**:
   - Writers publish → creates draft PR automatically
   - Maintainers review + merge → goes live

6. **Test thoroughly** before rolling out to non-technical contributors.

</Steps>

#### Benefits for Writers

- **No Git knowledge required**
- **No local setup** (just a browser)
- **Instant feedback** (see preview before publishing)
- **Clear workflow** (draft → review → publish)
- **Mobile-friendly** (write on your phone if needed)

#### Benefits for Maintainers

- **Code review still happens** (via GitHub PRs)
- **Full audit trail** (Git history preserved)
- **Quality control** (can reject/request changes before merge)
- **Scalability** (handle many writers without manual formatting work)
- **Flexibility** (Keystatic is headless — can integrate with other systems)

#### Next Steps

This is on our roadmap but not yet implemented. When you see the Keystatic admin panel go live, it will be a major milestone for Nadi Kosh. Suddenly, contributing will feel as easy as tweeting — and that is exactly what we want.

You also don’t have to wait for us to implement this alone.

If you are a developer who enjoys working on **content tooling, DX, or CMS integrations**, this is a beautiful area to contribute:

- You can help us **design and implement the Keystatic setup** (collections, schemas, workflows, GitHub OAuth).  
- You can experiment with **better CI/CD flows** for writers, preview builds, and editorial review.  
- You can propose improvements to our **Astro / Starlight / plugin architecture** so that Nadi Kosh remains simple to maintain even as it grows.

If this excites you, please:

1. Join our **Tech Group** in the Nadi Stuti WhatsApp community (link on **nadistuti.com**).  
2. Introduce yourself, share your experience with CMS / Astro / Git workflows, and mention that you are interested in the **Keystatic + writing experience** track.  

We are very open to ideas. Whether you want to lead the Keystatic integration, review our current stack, or suggest alternative approaches, your insight can shape how hundreds of future writers interact with Nadi Kosh.
