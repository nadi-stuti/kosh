The Nethravathi River, a lifeline of the South Kanara region in Karnataka, flows through one of the world's most significant biodiversity hotspots: the **Western Ghats**. Because it transitions from high-altitude shola forests to coastal estuaries, its flora and fauna are exceptionally diverse.
Here is a breakdown of the biodiversity found along and within the Nethravathi River.

🌿 Flora: From Peak to Coast
The vegetation changes dramatically as the river descends from the Kudremukh range toward the Arabian Sea.

1. **Riparian & Forest Vegetation**
   Evergreen & Semi-Evergreen: The upper reaches are dominated by towering trees like Teak, Rosewood, and Sandalwood.
   Shola Forests: Found at higher altitudes, these consist of stunted evergreen trees with a dense undergrowth of ferns and mosses.
   Riparian Corridors: Along the banks, you'll find specialized species that can withstand seasonal flooding, including various Bamboo species and water-loving ferns.
2. **Smaller Plants & Orchids**
   Orchids: The humid environment supports vibrant epiphytic orchids such as Vanda, Dendrobium, and Phalaenopsis.
   Medicinal Plants: The region is a "natural pharmacy," home to Garcinia cambogia (Malabar Tamarind) and Aloe vera.
   Mangroves: Near the estuary in Mangalore, mangrove species stabilize the banks and provide a nursery for marine life.

🐾 **Fauna: A Biodiversity Treasure**
The river ecosystem supports a wide range of terrestrial, avian, and aquatic animals.

1. **Aquatic Life (Fish & Crustaceans)**
   The Nethravathi is famous for its rich "water life," which supports thousands of local fishing families.
   Endemic Fish: Garra nethravathiensis is a species of cyprinid fish found only in this river system.
   Common Species: You will find Clarias dussumieri (Catfish), Etroplus suratensis (Pearl Spot/Karimeen), and various species of Barbs.
   Estuarine Prawns: Near the mouth, the river is rich in prawns like Penaeus indicus and Penaeus monodon (Tiger Prawn).
2. **Birds (Avifauna)**
   The river is a paradise for birdwatchers, especially during the migratory season (November–February).
   Forest Birds: Malabar Trogon, Great Pied Hornbill, and the Malabar Whistling Thrush.
   Water & Migratory Birds: Near the Mangalore estuary, you can spot Flamingos, Egrets, Herons, and River Terns.
3. **Mammals & Reptiles**
   **Mammals:** The forests surrounding the river are inhabited by the Malabar Giant Squirrel, Bonnet Macaque, Wild Boar, and Barking Deer. In the protected upstream areas, even the elusive Leopard and Tiger (from nearby Bhadra/Kudremukh) may be present.
   **Reptiles:** The region is a known habitat for the King Cobra. Other common reptiles include the Malabar Pit Viper and the Green Vine Snake.

Please Note: The Nethravathi ecosystem is currently considered ecologically sensitive. Issues like sand mining and river diversion projects (like the Yettinahole project) have raised concerns regarding the long-term survival of its unique aquatic species.
