## Problem

We have to prevent debris and waste water going from city to river. How to do that? What solutions we can approach?

## Possible solution

I was thinking how we can utilise the methods used in other countries to prevent sewage water entering rivers. Along the sewage water we have lot of plastic debris as well. How can we prevent this? We should study and have a seperate section in Kosh for tech enthusiasts to use AI/ML to research best methods.

For example in Bengaluru, sewage water goes to Vrishabhavathi river and Vrishabhavathi joins Arkavathy Arkavathy joins Kaveri. There is Kaveri water treatment plant and BWSSB teats it and send back to Bengaluru. Highly polluted Vrishabhavathy born in Kadu Malleshwara temple and Bull Temple in Basavanagudi. And Arkavathy comes from Nandi Hills. But Where is Arkavathy river? There is no water flow.
