This article give reasons on why we need verification summaries generated while doing deep search to solidify our output

To produce a superior final report, you should keep your **[{Topic Name} + Verification Report]** notes toggled **ON** during the final synthesis. Unlike the initial [Primary Subject Summary] created in Step 4, which included unvetted "fluff," these verification reports represent **verified documentation** that has been filtered through your "Who to Trust" criteria.

Keeping these reports active in your source panel provides several key advantages:

• **Establishing an Audit Trail:** These reports act as a "built-in audit trail". They connect the interesting topics you selected to the specific evidence found in expert documents, ensuring the AI doesn't have to "guess" which source supports which claim.

• **Navigating the "Needle in the Haystack":** While your primary scholarly PDFs contain the raw data, the verification reports provide the **semantic bridge**. They help the AI identify the specific "needle" of information (like a specific verse from the _Vishnu Purana_) within a large volume of text, which is essential for accurate drafting.

• **Strengthening Hallucination Defense:** By keeping these reports active, you reinforce the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** framework. The AI will prioritize these "clean" reports over its general training data, which reduces the risk of fabrication and ensures all claims are strictly grounded in your vetted research.

• **Improving Citation Accuracy:** When you ask the AI to generate the final manuscript in **APA 7 format**, having the verification reports on helps it cross-reference the synthesized facts with the primary source metadata (Author, Year) more effectively.

**Important Distinction for Step 6 Cleanup:** You should only toggle **OFF** the initial **[Primary Subject Summary]** and any **unvetted sources** (blogs/personal sites). The targeted verification reports created in Step 5 are considered part of your "verified corpus" and are critical for a high-integrity final output.

In summary, keeping these reports toggled **ON** allows the AI to "master the topic" by seeing both the broad connections and the specific evidence simultaneously
