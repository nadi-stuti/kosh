**Tagline:** Knowledge repository of our holy rivers

Nadi Kosh is a long‑term knowledge repository dedicated to India’s sacred rivers.  
Right now, this space works as a _dumping ground_ for all kinds of river‑related information, so that nothing is lost while the project is still evolving.

## What Nadi Kosh is doing right now

At this stage, Nadi Kosh focuses on **collecting and preserving** information rather than keeping everything perfectly organized:

- Adding many small Markdown files whenever new data, insights, or references appear.
- Capturing field notes, book highlights, research pointers, and tool ideas as quickly as possible.
- Accepting that the structure will look rough and “work‑in‑progress” for some time.

The goal is to make sure every observation about our holy rivers gets recorded somewhere, even if the file or folder name is not final yet.

## How this data will be used later

Over time, this raw and unorganized material will be:

- Cleaned up, grouped, and re‑structured into clear sections and well‑named folders.
- Enriched with citations and cross‑links between rivers, books, events, tools, and research.
- Transformed into **research papers, reports, guides, and educational content** about India’s sacred rivers.
- Used as the **core dataset** for building apps and tools that help people understand, experience, and serve our rivers in practical ways (for example: learning apps for students, decision‑support tools for cleaning projects, or devotional/educational experiences for devotees).

In simple terms:  
First, we _dump and preserve_ everything. Later, we _refine and publish_ formal work based on this living archive, and **power real-world apps and tools** that run on top of Nadi Kosh data.

## Long-term Vision for Nadi Kosh

Nadi Kosh aims to become **the definitive database of India's sacred rivers** - an extremely detailed, authoritative source containing every aspect of our holy rivers:

- **Comprehensive coverage:** Every river, every tributary, every sacred site, every historical reference, every scientific measurement.
- **IMDb for sacred rivers:** Just like IMDb serves filmmakers worldwide, Nadi Kosh will serve content creators, researchers, educators, and devotees through **public APIs**.
- **India's homegrown AI foundation:** Build **RAG models** trained exclusively on verified Nadi Kosh data, ensuring **no hallucinations or incorrect information** about our rivers.
- **Global utility:** From students learning about rivers, to researchers analyzing hydrology, to devotees planning pilgrimages - everyone gets accurate, culturally-rooted data.

**The dream:** A self-sustaining ecosystem where Nadi Kosh data powers apps, AI chatbots, games, research papers, and spiritual experiences - all while maintaining 100% accuracy about our sacred rivers.

## Why this “dump first, organize later” approach

Work on rivers is dynamic: field visits, new books, local stories, government reports, and scientific papers all appear at different times.  
If we wait for a perfect structure before saving anything, a lot of valuable knowledge will never be written down.

Nadi Kosh therefore prioritizes:

- Speed over perfection for note‑taking.
- Completeness over neatness in the early phase.
- Respect for every small piece of information about our rivers, whether it is spiritual, cultural, technical, or scientific.

This repository is the first step towards a deeper, data‑backed, and spiritually rooted understanding of our holy rivers.
