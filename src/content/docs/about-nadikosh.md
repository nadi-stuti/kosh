**Tagline:** Knowledge repository of our holy rivers

Nadi Kosh is a long‑term knowledge repository dedicated to India’s sacred rivers.  
Right now, this space works as a _dumping ground_ for all kinds of river‑related information, so that nothing is lost while the project is still evolving.

## A kosh for NadiStuti

Nadi Kosh is part of our larger movement **Nadi Stuti** (website: https://nadistuti.com), which is dedicated to India’s holy rivers.

In simple terms, the Nadi Stuti movement seeks to:

- **Restore the sanctity of rivers** to the same sacred stature as our temples, so that people see the river itself as a living place of worship.
- **Build the world’s largest and most trusted digital platform** for knowledge related to rivers, combining spiritual, cultural, historical, and scientific perspectives.
- **Unite everyone who serves the rivers** — from government bodies and experts to NGOs and grassroots sevaks — on a common platform and strengthen existing efforts.

Nadi Kosh serves as the **databank and knowledge repository** for the Nadi Stuti movement.  
Here we gather, store, and refine all the knowledge, information, leads, and data needed to support every aspect of Nadi Stuti’s work for rivers.

Right now, this space works as a _dumping ground_ for all kinds of river‑related information, so that nothing is lost while the project is still evolving.

## What Nadi Kosh is doing right now

At this stage, Nadi Kosh focuses on **collecting and preserving** information rather than keeping everything perfectly organized:

- Adding many small Markdown files whenever new data, insights, or references appear.
- Capturing field notes, book highlights, research pointers, and tool ideas as quickly as possible.
- Accepting that the structure will look rough and “work‑in‑progress” for some time.

The goal is to make sure every observation about our holy rivers gets recorded somewhere, even if the file or folder name is not final yet.

## How this data will be used later

Over time, this raw and unorganized material will be:

- Cleaned up, grouped, and re‑structured into clear sections and well‑named folders.
- Enriched with citations and cross‑links between rivers, books, events, tools, and research.
- Transformed into **research papers, reports, guides, and educational content** about India’s sacred rivers.
- Used as the **core dataset** for building apps and tools that help people understand, experience, and serve our rivers in practical ways (for example: learning apps for students, decision‑support tools for cleaning projects, or devotional/educational experiences for devotees).

In simple terms:  
First, we _dump and preserve_ everything. Later, we _refine and publish_ formal work based on this living archive, and **power real-world apps and tools** that run on top of Nadi Kosh data.

## Long-term Vision for Nadi Kosh

Nadi Kosh aims to become **the definitive database of India's sacred rivers** - an extremely detailed, authoritative source containing every aspect of our holy rivers:

- **Comprehensive coverage:** Every river, every tributary, every sacred site, every historical reference, every scientific measurement.
- **IMDb for sacred rivers:** Just like IMDb serves filmmakers worldwide, Nadi Kosh will serve content creators, researchers, educators, and devotees through **public APIs**.
- **India's homegrown AI foundation:** Build **RAG models** trained exclusively on verified Nadi Kosh data, ensuring **no hallucinations or incorrect information** about our rivers.
- **Global utility:** From students learning about rivers, to researchers analyzing hydrology, to devotees planning pilgrimages - everyone gets accurate, culturally-rooted data.

**The dream:** A self-sustaining ecosystem where Nadi Kosh data powers apps, AI chatbots, games, research papers, and spiritual experiences - all while maintaining 100% accuracy about our sacred rivers.

## Why this “dump first, organize later” approach

There is a very simple and honest reason behind this choice: we are a small team standing in front of a mountain of work.

1. A very small team, working in free time  
   Right now, everyone contributing to Nadi Kosh and Nadi Stuti is doing this seva in their limited free time, alongside jobs, studies, and family responsibilities.  
   Because of this, we are consciously prioritising **capturing knowledge** over **polishing structure**. If we first try to make everything perfect, we will lose precious insights that appear in the middle of a busy day.

2. Many fronts, one mission  
   The Nadi Stuti movement is not only about documentation. Even in this early phase, we are already trying to:

- Create new apps and software that support river cleaning and river awareness.
- Connect with people doing ground work and provide them with tools and support.
- Develop educational materials like videos, articles, and books.
- Organise events that educate people and encourage them to join this mission.

With so many parallel efforts, it is difficult to give full-time attention to neatly organising Nadi Kosh right now. So we accept a temporary “work-in-progress” state in exchange for moving the mission forward on multiple fronts.

3. Welcoming experts from many domains  
   We are inviting experts from different fields — environment, hydrology, policy, culture, scriptures, technology, education, and more — to contribute what they know to Nadi Kosh.  
   Naturally, this means the incoming data will be **unformatted, uneven, and unstructured** in the beginning. Instead of slowing experts down with strict formats, we first give them a simple place to pour their knowledge in.

4. Early phase of a long journey  
   We are still in the early phase of understanding how to shape the entire Nadi Stuti movement and how Nadi Kosh should eventually look.  
   Rather than spending years only planning, we chose to **start humbly**, accept imperfections, and trust that with the efforts of the community — and the blessings of Shreeman Narayan — the structure will gradually emerge and everything will fall into place.

We know that, at this stage, Nadi Kosh/Nadi Stuti may look naive and unstructured from the outside. But behind this rough appearance is a sincere intention: to serve our rivers first, collect as much truth as we can, and refine it step by step as more hearts and hands join this journey.
