import { Card, CardGrid, Aside, LinkButton } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The heart of our work is daily conversation that slowly turns into lasting knowledge.
We want people to talk freely, share what they see and feel, and then gradually shape those thoughts into long‑form articles that live inside Nadi Kosh as a permanent gift for future readers.

Right now we are still in the data / information / knowledge collection phase, so our focus is to:
- Encourage everyday discussions in our WhatsApp community, across different focused groups.
- Capture unstructured insights in the Dumping Grounds as raw notes and temporary drafts.
- Grow a culture where the best ideas are refined into structured, permanent articles in our blog and main folders.

In this way, contributions at every level — from a casual message, to a rough Markdown note, to a polished article — all help Nadi Kosh grow into a deep, trustworthy repository for the entire Nadi Stuti movement.

## Casual day to day conversation

We have set up several WhatsApp groups for different kinds of conversations.  
Each group has its own flavour, focus, and level of commitment.

<Aside type="note">
  - All groups are part of one Nadi Stuti WhatsApp community.  
  - We have created these groups to help people find conversations that suit their interests and availability.
  - Having multiple groups also helps keep the conversations organised and relevant.

## Raw ideas & temporary notes

Sometimes a short chat message is not enough.

You might have:

- A long, flowing chain of thoughts about our rivers.  
- A detailed suggestion or proposal for how Nadi Stuti or Nadi Kosh should grow.  
- An interesting piece of research, news article, or report that could help our cause.  
- Notes from a global or local event related to rivers or the environment.  
- Ideas for improving our websites, apps, or tools and how we might implement them.
- A collection of links, references, or resources that others might find useful.
- A rough draft of a blog post, article, or guide that you want to share for feedback.

When you want to write something that is **longer than a chat message**, **temporary**, and **not yet fully structured**, we have created a special zone for you:

> **Dumping Grounds** – a shared space for long, unstructured, draft‑style articles that the whole community can read, reflect on, and discuss.

Think of it as a public notebook for the Nadi Stuti community.  
Nothing here has to be perfect; it just has to be honest and useful.

You can contribute to the Dumping Grounds in two ways:

<Aside type="note">
  - All notes in the Dumping Grounds are written in **Markdown** format (`.md` files).  
  - If you are new to Markdown, check out this simple guide: [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
</Aside>

<CardGrid>

  <Card title="Local repository setup" icon="github">
    If you are comfortable with basic developer tools, you can add notes directly into the
    Dumping Grounds folder of Nadi Kosh.

    1. **Set up a local clone.**
       Follow our GitHub guide at [Github guide](/guides/github) to clone the Nadi Kosh repository
       to your computer.
    2. **Create a Markdown file.**
       Inside the repository, add a new `.md` file under
       `/dumping-grounds` with your thoughts, ideas, or notes.
    3. **Commit and push (or open a PR).**
       Commit your new file and push it, or open a pull request so maintainers can review and merge it.

    This path is ideal if you already use Git and VS Code and are comfortable working with repositories.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use a Markdown editor & share" icon="seti:markdown">
    If you are not comfortable with Git or local repositories, you can still contribute rich notes
    using any Markdown editor and our WhatsApp groups.

    **Step‑by‑step:**

    1. **Pick any Markdown editor you like.**
       Some popular options are:
       - **Obsidian**
       - **Typora**
       - **Dillinger / StackEdit**
    2. **Write your note.**
       Create a new Markdown file (`.md`) and put all your content in it:
       your thoughts, links, references, images (or image links), and suggestions.
    3. **Share the file.**
       Send the `.md` file to our _Content Creator_ WhatsApp group.
       A team member will manually upload it into the Nadi Kosh Dumping Grounds.

    This path is perfect for non‑technical contributors who still want to write long,
    thoughtful pieces in a simple editor.
  </Card>

</CardGrid>

<Aside type="caution">
  **Note:** Files in the Dumping Grounds are temporary articles.
  After extensive discussion and review, each note will either:
  
  - be cleaned up, structured, and merged into a permanent section of Nadi Kosh, or
  - be removed if it is no longer useful or has been superseded by better, clearer content.
  
  So please do not worry about perfection here. Focus on capturing your insight.
</Aside>

## Structured permanent articles

Not every idea should stay temporary.

Some thoughts mature into **clear, well‑structured articles** that can guide thousands of readers for years.  
For these, we use our **blog section** as the home for permanent, polished content.

Use the blog when you are ready to:

- Present a complete story, guide, or explanation.  
- Share something that has already been discussed and refined.  
- Create an article you would be happy to show to students, elders, and new visitors.


<Aside type="tip">
  Follow the same steps as above but use blog instead of dumping-grounds.
  - Use the Dumping Grounds when you want to capture ideas quickly without worrying about structure.<br />
  - Use the blog when you are ready to offer a polished, long‑lasting article to the wider world.
</Aside>

## Nadikosh's knowledge base

We will use information from these groups and notes to continuously improve Nadi Kosh knowledge base. If you want to directly contribute to Nadikosh knowledge base (Rivers, Tech, Tool etc) then use the above 2 methods of creating markdown files and share it with us.
