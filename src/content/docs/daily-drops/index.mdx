> Like how drops of water slowly fill a river, small daily stories can slowly refill our hearts with love and respect for our rivers.

**Daily Drops** is a small, everyday offering for the rivers of India.  
Each day, readers receive a short, simple story or insight connected to our holy rivers — something you can read in just a minute or two, but remember much longer.

## Why Daily Drops exists

- To gently turn our attention back to rivers as living, sacred mothers.  
- To make river-knowledge easy to absorb in our busy daily lives.  
- To connect devotion, culture, and ecology in one small daily moment.  

Just like a daily mantra-sādhana shapes the heart over time, a daily river-story can slowly change how we see and treat our rivers.

## What kinds of stories you’ll find

- Short facts about rivers, their journeys, and unique features.  
- Sacred stories, folklore, and local traditions connected to nadī.  
- Historical notes, cultural memories, and old ways of river-respect.  
- Real-life restoration and cleanup efforts happening today.  

Some drops will be text, some will be simple images, and some will flow into longer-form posts or videos.

## How to use Daily Drops

- Visit once a day, like a small darshan.  
- Read slowly, with gratitude for the rivers that sustain your life.  
- If a line touches you, carry it in your heart and actions that day.  

In time, these small daily **drops** can join together into a flowing inner river of awareness, devotion, and seva for the holy rivers of Bharat.
