This document explains the high‑level folder layout of Nadi Kosh and what each folder is meant to contain.  
The structure will keep evolving, but these are the current building blocks.

### `Nadi Stuti/`

This is the core philosophy folder.

We will document high level topics like what are our goals & mission and how are we going to achieve them.

### `Books/`

This folder collects knowledge from three kinds of books:

- **Educational books** for school students, college students, and competitive exams, especially where rivers, geography, environment, or culture are discussed.
- **Cleaning and management books** that describe methods, frameworks, and case studies for river cleaning and environmental restoration.
- **Ritual and spiritual books** that talk about the sacred role of rivers in scriptures, traditions, and religious practice.

Each book can have its own Markdown file with basic details, key learnings, and important references.

### `Events/`

This folder records what is happening on the ground:

- River cleaning events, campaigns, and drives.
- Educational events like talks, workshops, or school sessions.

Each event entry can include date, place, organisers, photos/links, what was done, and what was learned.

### `Guides/`

This folder is for people who want to understand or extend the Nadi Kosh wiki:

- How the Markdown‑based structure works.
- How to name files and folders.
- How to propose changes or add new content.

Over time, this can grow into a full contributor handbook.

### `Papers/`

This folder is about research:

- Notes and annotations from existing research papers related to rivers (science, policy, sociology, spirituality, etc.).
- Drafts of future research papers and reports that will be written using data stored in Nadi Kosh.

The idea is to have a clear bridge from raw notes to formal, citable work.

### `Rivers/`

Here the focus is on specific rivers:

- One file or subfolder per river (e.g., `ganga/`, `yamuna/`, `narmada/`), containing history, present condition, cultural stories, field data, and references.
- These entries may pull information from `books/`, `events/`, `papers/`, and `tools/`, but present it from the point of view of that river.

### `Team/`

This folder introduces the human and institutional side:

- Profiles of the core team working on Nadi Stuti.
- External collaborators like NGOs, ashrams, local groups, and other partners.

It helps readers see that this is a real, on‑ground, community‑driven effort.

### `Tech/`

This folder is for digital technology:

- Apps and software that help with data collection, analysis, visualisation, or education.
- Documentation of various tech being used to help clean rivers.
- Progress and information about tools that are being developed.

Subfolders such as `apps/`, `software/`, or `tech-news/` can be added as the project grows.

### `Tools/`

This folder explains the physical tools used in river work:

- Types of hardware (nets, boats, sensors, protective gear, etc.).
- How each tool works, where it can be purchased, how to maintain it, and any best practices.

The aim is to make practical river‑cleaning knowledge reusable for other teams across the country.

### `Thinking Grounds/`

This folder is the **free space for contributors**.

- Anyone can quickly drop unreviewed and unstructured notes here: ideas, observations, links, screenshots, or half‑written drafts.
- If you see, hear, or think of anything that might help the Nadi Stuti movement or deepen Nadi Kosh in the future, you can **dump it here without worrying about format or perfection**.

Later, maintainers will periodically review this folder and move useful content into the right long‑term locations (such as `books/`, `events/`, `papers/`, `rivers/`, etc.).  
The only rule is: **do not let a valuable thought get lost just because you do not have time to structure it right now.**
