title: About Thought Dumping
description: A safe space to pour your raw, unstructured ideas for Nadi Stuti and Nadi Kosh.
---

This folder is our **thinking ground**.

Not every idea is ready to become a polished article or a formal plan. Sometimes you just have:

- A half‑formed thought about our rivers
- An interesting link or news item
- Notes from a conversation or event
- A question, doubt, or wild experiment idea

Instead of letting these disappear in chat or memory, **dump them here**.

- No need to worry about grammar, structure, or perfection.
- Write freely, quickly, and honestly.
- Give your file a simple name and save it in this folder.

Later, as a community, we will read these notes, discuss them, and decide which ones should grow into:

- Proper Nadi Kosh pages
- Blog posts
- Guides, tools, or on‑ground experiments

If something feels even slightly useful for the Nadi Stuti movement, **do not keep it in your head**.

Put it here. Let the river of thoughts flow.
