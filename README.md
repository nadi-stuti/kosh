# Nadikosh

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

Nadikosh is the knowledge repository behind the **Nadi Stuti** movement – a community effort to honor and restore India’s sacred rivers.

This repo powers our public wiki + blog built with **Astro** and **Starlight**, where we collect, organize, and publish river‑related knowledge from many domains: scripture, culture, ecology, technology, education, and on‑ground work.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Read the [Repository structure](https://kosh.nadistuti.com/guides/developer-guide/#repository-structure) in our docs to understand project structure

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
